# FootballWinCalculator
Hello everyone, I wrote this simulation program to predict which football team is more likely to win a match with the highest possible probability.

However, it only works to a limited extent. This is of course due to the fact that there are many subjective factors that cannot be calculated, such as weather conditions or the motivation of the team.

The simulation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation principle and uses the following input values: xG (Expected Goals), goals per game, goals conceded per game, home advantage, and Elo rating.
